# BuddyRanker

## Inspiration
Friends playing squash looking for a way to rank themselves based on the outcomes of their individual games.

## Model: 
[Bradley-Terry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model): One of the applications of this model is too predict the outcome of a comparison based on a pair of individuals in a population where data exists on the past results of these players. The more data that exists, the more accurate the model becomes.  

## Use Cases
Any 2 player game (ex. squash, cribbage) in which a winner exists and can be recorded on a game by game basis. Players should partake in several games to increase accuracy.
